    It’s easy to be convinced that the myriad applications of AI pave a fun but nonetheless alarming digital path towards doom, doom, doom.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Let’s start with “slop”. It’s the term now used for AI-created graphic content pushed out on social media to attract engagement 
    using spectacular, surreal images – the kind that can digitally mash Jesus with prawns in photographic detail.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Those not entranced by the bizarre can be dangerously tempted by beauty, in the proliferation of anonymous social media accounts 
    posting AI-enhanced images celebrating western architecture and art. Historians and extremism researchers warn of a subtle pipeline 
    promoting cultural superiority through aesthetic bait.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4 font-['EB_Garamond']">
    From skepticism to reliance
  </h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    My personal anxieties about AI extended far beyond its misuse in politics or disinformation. 
    As a writer, I discovered that my work had been used to train AI models without consent or compensation – a discouraging blow to any creator.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Yet, my relationship with AI changed after I was formally diagnosed with ADHD. 
    In a moment of curiosity, I started using ChatGPT not as a threat but as an aid. 
    Months later, I find myself relying on it daily: the technology helps me quiet the mental noise and manage tasks that once felt overwhelming.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4 font-['EB_Garamond']">
    How AI became my silent assistant
  </h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The “time blindness” that comes with ADHD often leads to overcrowded schedules and constant lateness. 
    Now I outsource task prioritization to “the robot” on my phone. 
    It calculates travel times, suggests routes, and even adjusts my itinerary based on real-time changes.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    It remembers my dietary preferences, breaks down my exercise plan, and even advises me what to wear for the weather. 
    Most importantly, it never judges me. For someone with ADHD, that’s transformative.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 my-6">
    “One of ADHD’s principal tortures is shame in asking for help with simple tasks. The robot knows no judgment.”
  </blockquote>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The Australian government is now calling for guardrails on AI. Regulation is necessary, but so is recognizing 
    that AI can also be an empowering tool when used responsibly.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
    I may still be wary of AI’s darker implications, but I can’t deny its impact on my life. 
    As technology theorist Melvin Kranzberg once said: 
    “Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.” 
    For me, it’s become a lifeline.
