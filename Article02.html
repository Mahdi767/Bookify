    Student life is hard. Making new friends is hard. Writing essays is hard. Admin is hard. Budgeting is hard. 
    Finding out what trousers exist in the world other than black ones is also, apparently, hard.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Fortunately, for an AI-enabled generation of students, help with the complexities of campus life is just a prompt away. 
    If you are really stuck on an essay or can’t decide between management consulting or a legal career, 
    or need suggestions on what you can cook with tomatoes, mushrooms, beetroot, mozzarella, olive oil and rice, 
    then ChatGPT is there. It will listen to you, analyse your inputs, and offer up a perfectly structured paper, 
    a convincing cover letter, or a workable recipe for tomato and mushroom risotto with roasted beetroot and mozzarella.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I know this because three undergraduates have given me permission to eavesdrop on every conversation 
    they have had with ChatGPT over the past 18 months. Every eye-opening prompt, every revealing answer.

    AI at the heart of student life
  </h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    There has been a deluge of news about the student use of AI tools at universities, described by some as an existential 
    crisis in higher education. “ChatGPT has unravelled the entire academic project,” said New York magazine, 
    quoting a study suggesting that just two months after its 2022 launch, 90% of US college students were using ChatGPT 
    to help with assignments. A similar study in the UK published this year found that 92% of students were using AI in some form, 
    with nearly one in five admitting to including AI-generated text directly in their work.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    ChatGPT launched in November 2022 and swiftly grew to 100 million users just two months later. 
    In May this year, it was the fifth most-visited website globally, and, if patterns of previous years continue, 
    usage will drop over the summer while universities are on hiatus and ramp up again in September when term starts. 
    Students are the canaries in the AI coalmine. They see its potential to make their studies less strenuous, 
    to analyse and parse dense texts, and to elevate their writing to honours-degree standard. 
    And, once ChatGPT has proven helpful in one aspect of life, it quickly becomes a go-to for other needs and challenges.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The students who have given me unrestricted access to the ChatGPT Plus account they share, 
    and permission to quote from it, are all second-year undergraduates at a top British university. 
    Rohan studies politics and is the named account administrator. Joshua is studying history. 
    And Nathaniel, the heaviest user of the account, consulted ChatGPT extensively before changing courses 
    from maths to computer sciences.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4 font-['EB_Garamond']">
    12,000 prompts, 18 months, and a lot of surprises
  </h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I thought their chat log would contain a lot of academic research and bits and pieces of more random searches and queries. 
    I didn’t expect to find nearly 12,000 prompts and responses over an 18-month period, covering everything 
    from essay writing to mental health advice, career counselling, and even fancy dress inspiration.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Around half of all the conversations with “Chat” related to academic research, back and forths on individual essays 
    often going on for a dozen or more tightly packed pages of text. A query that started with Joshua asking ChatGPT 
    to fill in gaps in an essay finished 103 prompts and 58,000 words later with ChatGPT not only supplying the introduction 
    and conclusion but also compiling references and assessing the finished essay against marking criteria.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    The sophistication that goes into each piece of work co-authored by student and AI is impressive – 
    but it raises serious ethical questions. 
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4 font-['EB_Garamond']">
    Beyond academics: AI for life advice
  </h2>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    While academic work makes up the bulk of their interactions with ChatGPT, the students also use it for personal queries. 
    From health questions to emotional struggles, they turn to AI as an ever-present, judgment-free assistant. 
    But its answers are often unsourced, and the risk of misinformation looms large.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
    For example, Nathaniel asked ChatGPT to build him a hydration and nutrition plan for a boxing match. 
    While reasonable, the advice was unsourced and lacked expert verification. 
    This willingness to outsource decision-making to AI shows just how much students now trust it – 
    even when it shouldn't be the final authority.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
    Students are learning, growing, and relying on AI more than ever. 
    Whether that is helping them or making them dependent on it is the real question universities will soon have to answer.
